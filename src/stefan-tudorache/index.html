                  Life is a journey, or so they say.  Mine I imagine it being like a train. It goes from place to place, meeting different kind of people, some i took aboard with me some i left behind and as with any road, sometimes you get to see or experience wonderful things. What i like about this train though is that i built it path track by track and it will lead me as far as i am willing, able and daring. Even if i stopped from time to time , to catch my breath, i know there will always be the next station to go to.

                <p>As for my professional life, words will never do me much good, so if you are interested on my capabilities please follow the link to my work page. A thing worth mentioning is that the train principle is still valid, as i am building everyday and even though today i am at this station, tomorrow it will be another. I just hope we can help each other and together build a better future.</p>

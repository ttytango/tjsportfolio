          <h2>background</h2>
          <p>As a teenager I knew I was interested in tech but at that time I did not find the right scholastic path which led me to get into it in a professional way.
          I arrived in UK almost 5 years ago and started my career in hospitality. As time passed I became good at my job and got a managment position, while I had fun working in hospitality I've always been thinking about how fulfilling would have been to work in the tech industry.
          With the lock down arrival I had a lot of spare time to think about what I really wanted in my life, so I started studying the foundation of coding by myself and through online researches I came across _nology which made me realised I was still on time to make my career's dream come true.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>characteristics</h2>
          <p>I think of myself as a creative person, I'm also quite methodic on my way to do things as I do one task in different ways until I find what is the best way and then stuck to it, I'm also a collector and I like to display what I collect in the coolest and most organised way I can.</p> 
            <br>
          <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
          <p>I have been a gamer since I was a kid. I have always spent lots of time playing videogames, mainly rpg and always wanted to create one.
          I love swimming, coming from Sicily, a beautifull island in Italy I have always swum a lot in the sea during summer and swimming pool the rest of the year.
          I also love listening to music, watching movies and cooking trying new recipes from different cultures.</p>

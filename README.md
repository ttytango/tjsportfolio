# Everest Portfolio

A portfolio for the October 2020 intake at \_nology

## Using this repository

- Clone the repo to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/nology-tech/everest-portfolio.git`
- It's impossible to push directly to master, so you'll need to make a branch

```
git checkout -b branch-name (To create a new branch)
or
git checkout branch-name (If you're moving to an existing branch)
```

You can check existing branches with `git branch -a`

- Make some changes!
- When you're happy with them `git add -A` and `git commit -m "Your message"`
- Update your branch to be inline with the main branch `git pull origin main`
- Push your changes to the remote repository `git push origin branch-name`
- Open a "pull request" on github
- Get a fellow student to review and approve this pull request and merge it into master

Start the cycle again from "Make some changes!"
